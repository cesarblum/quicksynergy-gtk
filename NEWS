QuickSynergy 0.2
-----------------------

28 Dec. 2005 - QuickSynergy 0.2 is now released! The great new feature is that now the last server setup is saved so that when the user opens the application again, the same client hostnames will still be there. Also, the website URL was corrected on the about dialog.
