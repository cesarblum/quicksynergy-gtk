This is the README file for QuickSynergy, version 0.5 for Linux.

QuickSynergy is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for synergy, an
application that allows the user to share his/her mouse and keyboard
between two or more computers over a simple TCP/IP network. This is
also known as "software KVM", altough in true KVM the monitor is also
shared.

The motivation to write QuickSynergy was the fact that there was no
graphical interface for the Linux and Mac versions of synergy. Since
many users do not enjoy writting configuration files by hand, we
decided to make a simple graphical tool that would do such job.

It is important to note that the aim of QuickSynergy is not to
provide a full-featured user interface, but only an interface that is
as simple as possible that allows the user to quickly get synergy
running on his/her machines.

Usage:

    * if you want to start a synergy server, select the Server tab on the main
    window and fill in the text boxes according to the position where the other
    machines are located.
    
    * otherwise, if you want tu run a synergy client, select the Client tab
    and type in the hostname or the local IP address of the machine running 
    the server.
    
    * after configuring a server or a client, just click the Start button. If
    you want to change anything, click it again (it is going to be labeled
    "Stop" this time), make any changes you want, and click the Start button 
    again.
    
    * the Settings tab allows you to set an option that will keep synergy 
    running even after you close QuickSynergy.
    
Please also note that you need to have synergy installed on you system before
you can use QuickSynergy. The Linux version does not have synergy bundled with 
it.

Bug reports may be sent directly to the authors of the program. Contact
