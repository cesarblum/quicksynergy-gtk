QuickSynergy
---------------

QuickSynergy is a graphical user interface (GUI) for easily configuring Synergy2 on Mac OS and Linux Systems, an application that allows the user to share his mouse and keyboard between two or more computers.

Without the need for any external hardware, Synergy2 uses the TCP/IP protocol to share resources, even between machines with different operating systems, such as Mac OS, Linux or Windows.


Installation Instructions
----------------------------

Just follow the usual procedure:

./configure
make
make install

You will need the GTK 2.0 and libglade-2.0 development packges installed on your computer in order to achieve a successful compilation.
