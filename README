This is the README file for QuickSynergy, version 0.6 for Linux.

QuickSynergy is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for synergy, an
application that allows the user to share his/her mouse and keyboard
between two or more computers over a simple TCP/IP network. This is
also known as "software KVM", altough in true KVM the monitor is also
shared.

The motivation to write QuickSynergy was the fact that there was no
graphical interface for the Linux and Mac versions of synergy. Since
many users do not enjoy writting configuration files by hand, we
decided to make a simple graphical tool that would do such job.

It is important to note that the aim of QuickSynergy is not to
provide a full-featured user interface, but only an interface that is
as simple as possible that allows the user to quickly get synergy
running on his/her machines.

Usage:

    * in order to share the machine's mouse and keyboard, select the Share
    tab on the main window and type the hostnames of the other machines in
    the text boxes.
    
    * in order to use another machine's mouse and keyboard, select the Use
    tab and type the hostname or the IP address of the server machine.
    
    * after configuring a server or a client, just click the Start button. If
    you want to change anything, click it again (it is going to be labeled
    "Stop" this time), make any changes you want, and click the Start button 
    again.
    
    * the Settings tab allows you to choose wether to keep synergy running
    after QuickSynergy is closed or not.
    
Also note that you need to have synergy installed on your system before
you can use QuickSynergy. The Linux version does not come with synergy bundled
with it.

Bug reports may be sent directly to the authors of the program. Contact
information may be found in the AUTHORS file.
