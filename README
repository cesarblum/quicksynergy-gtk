This is the README file for QuickSynergy, version 0.8 for Linux.

QuickSynergy is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for synergy, an
application that allows the user to share his/her mouse and keyboard
between two or more computers over a simple TCP/IP network. This is
also known as "software KVM", altough in true KVM the monitor is also
shared.

The motivation to write QuickSynergy was the fact that there was no
graphical interface for the Linux and Mac versions of synergy. Since
many users do not enjoy writting configuration files by hand, we
decided to make a simple graphical tool that would do such job.

It is important to note that the aim of QuickSynergy is not to
provide a full-featured user interface, but only an interface that is
as simple as possible and that allows users to quickly get synergy
running on their machines.

Usage:
- To share the machine's mouse and keyboard, select the Share
  tab on the main window and type the hostnames of the other machines in
  the text boxes.
    
- To use another machine's mouse and keyboard, select the Use
  tab and type the hostname or the IP address of the machine whose
  mouse and keyboard are being shared.
    
- After configuration, click the Start button.
  If you want to change anything, click it again (it is going to be 
  labeled "Stop" this time), make any changes you want, and click 
  the Start button again.
    
Also note that you need to have synergy installed on your system before 
you can use QuickSynergy. The Linux version does not come with synergy 
bundled with it.

Bug reports may be sent directly to the authors of the program. Contact 
information may be found in the AUTHORS file.
