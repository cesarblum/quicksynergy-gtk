		* New logo

		* Removed misc.h file from source.

		* Removed a lot of repeated code by writing the function
		screen_entry_new which creates a new GtkEntry and connects
		focus-in and focus-out callbacks to it. This entry is used
		to hold the hostname/IP address of a client screen when
		setting up a synergy server.

		* main.c: Former Server tab is now the Share tab.

		* main.c: Former Client tab if now the Use tab.

		* configure.in: added some missing tests.

		* main.c: new "Settings" tab.

		* main.c: added a few comments to the code.

		* callbacks.c: program behaviour redefined. Now the
		GtkNotebook gets disabled, not specific widgets acoording
		to what the user has run (server or client).

		* callbacks.c: synergy process control code rewritten.
		No more zombie processes :-)

		* config.c: functions load and save the new KeepRunning 
		option.

		* new application logo.

		anymore).
