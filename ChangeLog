		by a call to mkdir() with a string which did not
		contain any valid filename in it.

		* Removed misc.h file from source.

		* Removed a lot of repeated code by writing the function
		screen_entry_new which creates a new GtkEntry and connects
		focus-in and focus-out callbacks to it. This entry is used
		to hold the hostname/IP address of a client screen when
		setting up a synergy server.

		* main.c: Former Server tab is now the Share tab.

		* main.c: Former Client tab if now the Use tab.

		option.

		* new application logo.
