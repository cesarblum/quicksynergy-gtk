QuickSynergy is a simple graphical user
interface for synergy, an application that allows you to share
your mouse and keyboard with other computers over a TCP/IP network.
This is also known as "software KVM", altough in true
KVM the monitor is also shared.

QuickSynergy does not aim to provide a full-featured user interface.
Instead, it provides an interface that is as simple as possible and that
allows users to promptly get synergy running on their machines.
